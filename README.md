# Angular QuickStart Source

This repository holds the TypeScript source code of the [angular.io quickstart](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html),
the foundation for most of the documentation samples and potentially a good starting point for your application.

This project serves as a demo to help others get started with Angular.  I will attempt to document what I have learned in the hope that 
it serves as a point of reference for others who are attempting to use similar tools.

So far I have been fairly successful with using ng-bootstrap.  My application currently uses the modal component.  
I figured out how to pass content into a modal dialog.  
The key is to pass in your content to the ModalService object.  Currently I am only able to pass in intrinsic values and not a complex object like a class. Hopefully I will resolve this issue.
